- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## 5. Test Execution Strategy

When and how should Playwright tests run?

- [ ] (A) **On Every Commit** - Part of pre-commit hooks or CI checks
- [ ] (B) **Nightly Build** - Scheduled execution for comprehensive testing
- [ ] (C) **Manual Trigger** - Run on-demand before releases
- [ ] (D) **Pull Request Only** - Run only on PR validation
- [ ] (E) Other (describe): manual trigger and CI check

## 6. Integration with Existing TDD Workflow

How should Playwright fit into the strict TDD methodology?

- [x] (A) **Complementary E2E Layer** - Add after unit/integration tests pass
- [ ] (B) **Behavior-Driven Development** - Use Playwright for BDD scenarios
- [ ] (C) **Test-First UI Development** - Write failing Playwright tests first
- [ ] (D) **Regression Testing Focus** - Validate existing functionality
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## 7. Reporting and Debugging

What level of test reporting and debugging support is needed?

- [ ] (A) **Basic Pass/Fail Reports** - Simple test results
- [ ] (B) **Detailed HTML Reports** - Screenshots, videos, traces on failure
- [ ] (C) **Live Debugging Support** - Headed mode for development
- [ ] (D) **CI/CD Integration** - GitHub Actions reporting integration
- [x] (E) Other (describe): whatever is best-recommended for Playwright and this type of app

## 8. Performance Considerations

How should test performance and execution time be handled?

- [x] (A) **Optimized for Speed** - Parallel execution, minimal waits
- [ ] (B) **Comprehensive Over Fast** - Thorough testing prioritized over speed
- [ ] (C) **Smart Test Selection** - Run subsets based on code changes
- [ ] (D) **Configurable Test Sets** - Quick vs. comprehensive test modes
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## 9. Maintenance and Scalability

How should the test suite be structured for long-term maintenance?

- [ ] (A) **Page Object Model** - Organized by application pages
- [ ] (B) **Feature-Based Structure** - Organized by user stories/features
- [x] (C) **Hybrid Approach** - Mix of page objects and feature organization
- [ ] (D) **Component-Based Testing** - Reusable UI component tests
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## 10. Success Criteria and Metrics

How will we measure the success of the Playwright test implementation?

- [x] (A) **Code Coverage Metrics** - Percentage of UI flows covered
- [ ] (B) **Bug Detection Rate** - Number of issues found in production
- [ ] (C) **Test Execution Time** - Under 10 minutes for full suite
- [ ] (D) **Developer Adoption** - Team usage and satisfaction
- [ ] (E) Other (describe)

## Additional Context

Please provide any additional requirements, constraints, or considerations for the Playwright test suite implementation:

- **Resources**: Who will be involved in implementation and maintenance?
  - just me for now. think about it from an engineering perspective
- **Constraints**: Any technical or organizational limitations?
  - nope
- **Preferences**: Specific tools, patterns, or approaches you prefer?
  - Ensure that Page Object Model is used, but tests should be grouped by feature/user stories
