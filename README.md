## Development Standards

⚠️ **Important**: This project follows **Strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology. All feature implementations must follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while maintaining tests

See the [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed TDD requirements and development workflow.
